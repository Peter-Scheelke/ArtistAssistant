The ArtistAssistant program allows the user to create landscapes.
To run the program, either run it from the Visual Studio solution
file or run one of the executable files in the bin folder.

Once the program is open, you can create a new drawing in a couple ways.
First, you can download an existing drawing by clicking the button with
the cloud and down arrow on it. This will open a menu that contains a list
of pre-existing drawings. Selecting one of them and clicking the "Download"
button will open the drawing on the screen.

The second method for creating a drawing is to click the top button in the
main menu. This will allow the user to either open a menu to select a
background color or open a file dialog to allow the user to select a
background image file. After selecting either a background color or a
background image, clicking "Start Drawing" will create a new drawing.

Creating a new drawing while a drawing is currently open will delete
the current drawing from the ArtistAssistant (the drawing can still be
accessed if it was saved to the cloud).

Once a drawing is created, it can be saved by clicking the cloud button
with an up arrow on it. This will open a menu that allows the user to enter
a file name. After doing so and clicking "Upload," the drawing will be uploaded
to the cloud. It can be accessed in the future using the download process
described above.

While a drawing is open, it can be edited in the following ways:

1. Selection: Clicking the button with a cursor on it will set the
ArtistAssistant's drawing mode to select (pressing the S key is a shortcut
for turning on select mode). While select mode is active, clicking on
objects added to the drawing will select them (they will also have a black
border added to them). Control + D is a shortcut for deselecting the
currently selected object.

2. Movement: Clicking the button with four perpendicular arrows on it will
set the ArtistAssistant's drawing mode to move. While this mode is selected,
clicking on the drawing will move the currently selected object to the location
that was clicked. Pressing the M key is a shortcut for activating movement mode.

3. Addition: Clicking the button with a pencil drawing on a sheet of paper will
set the ArtistAssistant's drawing mode to addition mode. It will also open a
menu that allows the user to select which type of object to add to the drawing
(the user can also select the size that those images should be). Clicking on the
drawing with addition mode selected will add an object to the drawing. Pressing
the N key is a shortcut for selecting addition mode.

4. Scale: Clicking the button with the square in it will open a menu that allows
the user to scale the currently selected object. Entering the new dimensions that the
object should have and clicking "Scale" will change the object's dimensions to the new
dimensions.

5. Duplication: Clicking the button containing two overlapping rectangles will duplicate
the currently selected object. The new object will appear slightly below and to the left
of the orignal object. The duplicate object will become selected. Pressing Control + V is
a shortcut for duplicating an object.

6. The two buttons below the duplication mode allow the user move the currently selected
object to the front of the drawing or to the back of the drawing (the top button brings
the object to the front). Control + F is a shortcut to bring the currently selected
object to the front of the drawing. Control + B is a shortcut to send the currently
selected object to the back of the drawing.

7. The button containing a trash can deletes the currently selected object from the drawing.
Pressing the Delete key is a shortcut for deleting the currently selected object.

8. Undo: The bottom button containing the arrow is the undo button. Clicking it will undo
the most recent command that has not been undone (this includes a selection change). Please
note that some changes are undone in multiple steps (the duplication command, for example,
consists of an add command being executed, then a move command, and the finally a select command).
Pressing Control + Z is a shortcut for undoing changes.
